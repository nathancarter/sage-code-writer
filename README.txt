If you're browsing this Sage project, and want to know what it does, I suggest reading things in this order:

1. Open example.sagews and play with it as the comments in that worksheet instruct you to do.
2. Open recipes.txt and see the format for where it's getting the suggestions it presents to you.
3. Open nocodeplease.sage and read all the comments around the code.
4. Open nocodeplease.js and read all the comments in the code.
5. Open modal.js if you want to, but it's not really very important; it's just UI support code.

If you have any questions, contact Nathan Carter (ncarter@bentley.edu), the author of these files.

The file all.tasks was mostly for me (Nathan) to use during Sage Education Days 6, where most of this code was written.
The file slide.sagews was for me to use during a presentation given at those same SEDays.
