Sage Code Writer
----------------

This project adds to the Sage Math Cloud UI tools that write code
for the user, in simple use cases.  This is just a
proof-of-concept and is not yet beautiful or especially useful.
The aim of creating it was to get people interested, so that they
could take it from here, improving it steadily until it becomes
good enough to include in the Sage Math Cloud code itself.

For more information, you can watch the following video, but it is
26 minutes long.  But the nice thing about videos is that you
don't have to download or install anything to watch one!

To learn more about this project, proceed as follows:

Before you can use this code, you must place it in a project in
your Sage Math Cloud account; it can only functions there.

1. Get these files into a Sage Math Cloud project, by doing ONE
   OR THE OTHER of the following two items (not both) in a new
   project in your Sage Math Cloud account:
   a. Manually upload into that project all the files in this
      repository.
   OR
   b. Clone this repository into that account by issuing the
      following command at a terminal prompt in the project.
$ git clone https://github.com/nathancarter/sage-code-writer.git

2. From the Sage Math Cloud web interface for the project into
   which you've uploaded these files, Open example.sagews and play
   with it, as the comments in that worksheet instruct you to do.

3. Open recipes.txt and see the format for where it's getting the
   suggestions it presents to you.

4. Open nocodeplease.sage and read all the comments around the
   code.

5. Open nocodeplease.js and read all the comments in the code.

6. Optionally also open modal.js, but it's not really very
   important; it's just UI support code.

If you have any questions, contact Nathan Carter
(ncarter@bentley.edu), the author of the initial commit in this
repository.

The file all.tasks was mostly for Nathan to use during
Sage Education Days 6, where most of this code was written.
The file slide.sagews was for me to use during a presentation
given at those same SEDays, which was recorded on video, and
appears on YouTube at the link given at the top of this file.
